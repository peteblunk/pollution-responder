# **App Name**: Diesel Dilemma RPG

## Core Features:

- Character Creation: Interactive Stat Sheet: Allows creation of responder characters with Skill, Preparedness, and Luck stats, influenced by training and experience.
- Dice Roll System: Dice Roll Simulation: Implements a virtual dice-rolling system for resolving actions and determining scenario outcomes.
- Dynamic Scenario: Branching Narrative: Dynamically alters the game scenario based on user decisions and dice roll results, offering a non-linear training experience.
- ICS-201 Generator: ICS-201 Form Generator: Guides the user through creating an ICS-201 form within the app, pre-populating based on prior game events and rolls.
- Collaborative Whiteboard: Digital Whiteboard: Allow a place for responders to visualize key components such as hazard zones, vessel diagrams, or ACP components, adding another element of real-time resource managements.
- Saved Game State: Persistent Game State: Game can be bookmarked so that the experience does not need to start over if it is not completed during an individual training time.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy blue (#1A237E), evoking the US Coast Guard.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), providing a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFEB3B), inspired by hazard warnings to draw attention to key elements and interactive components.
- USCG Blue: Incorporate PMS 307 C (HEX: #005DAA) from the official US Coast Guard colors.
- USCG Red: Incorporate PMS 179 C (HEX: #DA291C) from the official US Coast Guard colors.
- Body text: 'PT Sans' sans-serif, for the longer passages of text, to maintain clarity and readability.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, for titles and section headers, to evoke a serious, urgent and modern feel.
- Use of clear and representative icons derived from US Coast Guard symbolism such as boats, and eagles, emphasizing easy to recognize and official design.
- Classic layout: The stat sheet should strongly resemble the actual stat sheet used in the classroom setting in order to not require participants to undergo too much training to learn the tool.
